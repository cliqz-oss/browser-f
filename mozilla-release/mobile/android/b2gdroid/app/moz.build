# Make aapt generate org/mozilla/gecko/R.java.  There's a problem hidden here:
# the GeckoView classes may reference resources provided by other packages.
# That is, the GeckoView JAR files may reference android.support.v7.appcompat.R
# (say) at runtime.  That class is in the gecko-R.jar file which is not (and can
# not!) be included as part of GeckoView.  To avoid this, we'd need to include
# the transitive set of resource classes.  For now, let's assume that b2gdroid
# will not induce accesses to other package's resources at runtime.
