# The GeckoView consuming APK depends on the GeckoView JAR files.  There are two
# issues: first, the GeckoView JAR files need to be built before they are
# consumed here.  This happens for delicate reasons.  In the (serial) libs tier,
# base/ is traversed before b2gdroid/app.  Since base/libs builds classes.dex,
# the underlying JAR files are built before the libs tier of b2gdroid/app is
# processed.  Second, there is a correctness issue: the GeckoView JAR providing
# org.mozilla.gecko.R does not have the correct resource IDs for the consuming
# application, so we skip it.  The b2gdroid APK builds a JAR containing
# org.mozilla.gecko.R itself.
