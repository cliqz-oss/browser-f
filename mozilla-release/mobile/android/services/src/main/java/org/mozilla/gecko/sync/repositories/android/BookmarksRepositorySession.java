  /**
   * Some notes on reparenting/reordering.
   *
   * Fennec stores new items with a high-negative position, because it doesn't care.
   * On the other hand, it also doesn't give us any help managing positions.
   *
   * We can process records and folders in any order, though we'll usually see folders
   * first because their sortindex is larger.
   *
   * We can also see folders that refer to children we haven't seen, and children we
   * won't see (perhaps due to a TTL, perhaps due to a limit on our fetch).
   *
   * And of course folders can refer to local children (including ones that might
   * be reconciled into oblivion!), or local children in other folders. And the local
   * version of a folder -- which might be a reconciling target, or might not -- can
   * have local additions or removals. (That causes complications with on-the-fly
   * reordering: we don't know in advance which records will even exist by the end
   * of the sync.)
   *
   * We opt to leave records in a reasonable state as we go, applying reordering/
   * reparenting operations whenever possible. A final sequence is applied after all
   * incoming records have been handled.
   *
   * As such, we need to track a bunch of stuff as we go:
   *
   * • For each downloaded folder, the array of children. These will be server GUIDs,
   *   but not necessarily identical to the remote list: if we download a record and
   *   it's been locally moved, it must be removed from this child array.
   *
   *   This mapping can be discarded when final reordering has occurred, either on
   *   store completion or when every child has been seen within this session.
   *
   * • A list of orphans: records whose parent folder does not yet exist. This can be
   *   trimmed as orphans are reparented.
   *
   * • Mappings from folder GUIDs to folder IDs, so that we can parent items without
   *   having to look in the DB. Of course, this must be kept up-to-date as we
   *   reconcile.
   *
   * Reordering also needs to occur during fetch. That is, a folder might have been
   * created locally, or modified locally without any remote changes. An order must
   * be generated for the folder's children array, and it must be persisted into the
   * database to act as a starting point for future changes. But of course we don't
   * want to incur a database write if the children already have a satisfactory order.
   *
   * Do we also need a list of "adopters", parents that are still waiting for children?
   * As items get picked out of the orphans list, we can do on-the-fly ordering, until
   * we're left with lonely records at the end.
   *
   * As we modify local folders, perhaps by moving children out of their purview, we
   * must bump their modification time so as to cause them to be uploaded on the next
   * stage of syncing. The same applies to simple reordering.
