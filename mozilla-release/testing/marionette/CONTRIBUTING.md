Contributing
============

We are delighted that you want to help improve Marionette!
‘Marionette’ means different a few different things, depending
on who you talk to, but the overall scope of the project involves
these components:

  * [_Marionette_] is a Firefox remote protocol to communicate with,
    instrument, and control Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox
    and Fennec.  It is built in to Firefox and written in [XPCOM]
    flavoured JavaScript.

    It serves as the backend for the geckodriver WebDriver implementation,
    and is used in the context of Firefox UI tests, reftesting,
    Web Platform Tests, test harness bootstrapping, and in many
    other far-reaching places where browser instrumentation is required.

  * [_geckodriver_] provides the HTTP API described by the [WebDriver
    protocol] to communicate with Gecko-based browsers such as
    Firefox and Fennec.  It is a standalone executable written in
    Rust, and can be used with compatible W3C WebDriver clients.

  * [_webdriver_] is a Rust crate providing interfaces, traits
    and types, errors, type- and bounds checks, and JSON marshaling
    for correctly parsing and emitting the [WebDriver protocol].

Writing code
============

Because there are many moving parts involved remote controlling
a web browser, it can be challenging to a new contributor to know
where to start.  Please don’t hesitate to [ask questions]!

The canonical source code repository is [mozilla-central].  Bugs are
filed in the [`Testing :: Marionette`] component on Bugzilla.  We also
have a curated set of [good first bugs] you may consider attempting first.

We have collected a lot of good advice for working on Marionette
code in <doc/CodeStyle.md>, which we highly recommend you read.
There is more development documentation archived under <doc/index.rst>
that you may peruse at your convenience.

Building
--------

Marionette is built in to Firefox and ships in the official
Firefox binary.  As Marionette is written in [XPCOM] flavoured
JavaScript, you may choose to rely on so called [artifact builds],
which will download pre-compiled Firefox blobs to your computer.
This means you don’t have to compile Firefox locally, but does
come at the cost of having a good internet connection.  To enable
[artifact builds] you may choose ‘Firefox for Desktop Artifact
Mode’ when bootstrapping.

Once you have a clone of [mozilla-unified], you can set up your
development environment by running this command and following the
on-screen instructions:

	% ./mach bootstrap

To perform a regular build, simply do:

	% ./mach build

You can clean out the objdir using this command:

	% ./mach clobber

Occasionally a clean build will be required after you fetch the
latest changes from mozilla-central.  You will find that the the
build will error when this is the case.  To automatically do clean
builds when this happens you may optionally add this line to the
_mozconfig_ file in your top source directory:

	mk_add_options AUTOCLOBBER=1

If you compile Firefox frequently you will also want to enable
[ccache] and [sccache] if you develop on a macOS or Linux system:

	mk_add_options 'export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache'
	mk_add_options 'export CCACHE_CPP2=yes'
	ac_add_options --with-ccache

Running tests
-------------

We verify and test Marionette in a couple of different ways.
Marionette has a set of [xpcshell] unit tests located in
_testing/marionette/test_*.js_.  These can be run this way:

	% ./mach test testing/marionette/test_*.js

Because tests are run in parallell and xpcshell itself is quite
chatty, it can sometimes be useful to run the tests sequentially:

	% ./mach test --sequential testing/marionette/test_error.js

These unit tests run as part of the _X_ jobs on Treeherder.

We also have a set of functional tests that make use of the Marionette
Python client.  These start a Firefox process and tests the Marionette
protocol input and output.  The following command will run all tests:

	% ./mach test mn

But you can also run individual tests:

	% ./mach test testing/marionette/harness/marionette_harness/tests/unit/test_navigation.py

When working on Marionette code it is often useful to surface the
stdout from Firefox:

	% ./mach test --gecko-log - TEST

It is common to use this in conjunction with an option to increase
the Marionette log level:

	% ./mach test --gecko-log - -vv TEST

A single `-v` enables debug logging, and a double `-vv` enables
trace logging.

As these are functional integration tests and pop up Firefox windows
sporadically, a helpful tip is to surpress the window whilst you
are running them by using Firefox’ [headless mode]:

	% ./mach test -z TEST

`-z` is an alias for `--headless` and equivalent to setting the
`MOZ_HEADLESS` output variable.  In addition to `MOZ_HEADLESS`
there is also `MOZ_HEADLESS_WIDTH` and `MOZ_HEADLESS_HEIGHT` for
controlling the dimensions of the no-op virtual display.  This is
similar to using xvfb(1) which you may know from the X windowing system,
but has the additional benefit of also working on macOS and Windows.

We have a separate page documenting how to write good Python tests in
<doc/PythonTests.md>.  These tests will run as part of the _Mn_
job on Treeherder.

In addition to these two test types that specifically test the
Marionette protocol, Marionette is used as the backend for the
[geckodriver] WebDriver implementation.  It is served by a WPT test
suite which effectively tests conformance to the W3C specification.

This is a good try syntax to use when testing Marionette changes:

	-b do -p linux,linux64,macosx64,win64,android-api-16 -u marionette-e10s,marionette-headless-e10s,xpcshell,web-platform-tests,firefox-ui-functional-local-e10s,firefox-ui-functional-remote-e10s -t none

Submitting patches
------------------

You can submit patches by uploading .diff files to Bugzilla or by
sending them to [MozReview].

Once you have contributed a couple of patches, we are happy to
sponsor you in [becoming a Mozilla committer].  When you have been
granted commit access level 1 you will have permission to use the
[Firefox CI] to trigger your own “try runs” to test your changes.
