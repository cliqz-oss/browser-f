Marionette
==========

Marionette is the remote protocol that lets out-of-process programs
communicate with, instrument, and control Gecko-based browsers.

It provides interfaces for interacting with both the internal
JavaScript runtime and UI elements of Gecko-based browsers, such
as Firefox and Fennec.  It can control both the chrome- and content
documents, giving a high level of control and ability to replicate,
or emulate, user interaction.

Marionette can be activated by passing the `-marionette` flag. To
start Firefox with the remote protocol turned on::

	% firefox -marionette
	…
	1491228343089   Marionette  INFO    Listening on port 2828

This binds to a TCP socket, over which clients can communicate with
Marionette using the `protocol`_.
