 * Test for bug 401869 to allow multiple words separated by spaces to match in
 * the page title, page url, or bookmark title to be considered a match. All
 * terms must match but not all terms need to be in the title, etc.
 *
 * Test bug 424216 by making sure bookmark titles are always shown if one is
 * available. Also bug 425056 makes sure matches aren't found partially in the
 * page title and partially in the bookmark.
