/**
 * Test bug 393678 to make sure matches against the url, title, tags are only
 * made on word boundaries instead of in the middle of words.
 *
 * Make sure we don't try matching one after a CamelCase because the upper-case
 * isn't really a word boundary. (bug 429498)
 *
 * Bug 429531 provides switching between "must match on word boundary" and "can
 * match," so leverage "must match" pref for checking word boundary logic and
 * make sure "can match" matches anywhere.
