Shield Recipe Client
====================

Normandy (aka the Shield Recipe Client) is a targeted change control
system, allowing small changes to be made within a release of Firefox,
such as studies. It downloads recipes and actions from the `recipe
server`_, verifies their cryptographic signatures, and then executes
them.
