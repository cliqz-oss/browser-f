/**
 * An R-Tree implementation. In short, it is a balanced n-ary tree containing a hierarchy of
 * bounding rectangles.
 *
 * Much like a B-Tree it maintains balance by enforcing minimum and maximum child counts, and
 * splitting nodes when they become overfull. Unlike B-trees, however, we're using spatial data; so
 * there isn't a canonical ordering to use when choosing insertion locations and splitting
 * distributions. A variety of heuristics have been proposed for these problems; here, we're using
 * something resembling an R*-tree, which attempts to minimize area and overlap during insertion,
 * and aims to minimize a combination of margin, overlap, and area when splitting.
 *
 * One detail that is thus far unimplemented that may improve tree quality is attempting to remove
 * and reinsert nodes when they become full, instead of immediately splitting (nodes that may have
 * been placed well early on may hurt the tree later when more nodes have been added; removing
 * and reinserting nodes generally helps reduce overlap and make a better tree). Deletion of nodes
 * is also unimplemented.
 *
 * For more details see:
 *
 *  Beckmann, N.; Kriegel, H. P.; Schneider, R.; Seeger, B. (1990). "The R*-tree:
 *      an efficient and robust access method for points and rectangles"
 *
 * It also supports bulk-loading from a batch of bounds and values; if you don't require the tree
 * to be usable in its intermediate states while it is being constructed, this is significantly
 * quicker than individual insertions and produces more consistent trees.
