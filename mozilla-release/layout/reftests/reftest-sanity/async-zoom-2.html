<!-- There is a bug with MultiTiledContentClient that causes improper painting;
     bug 1204076 is on file for this issue. As a temporary workaround, we set
     user-scalable=no here so that WantAsyncZoom() returns false and we don't
     use a MultiTiledContentClient. Once bug 1204076 is fixed, we can remove this. -->
