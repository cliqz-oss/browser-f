W3C CSS Test Suite Directory
----------------------------

This directory is for tests that are sync'ed with the official
W3C CSS test suites at https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/.
 
submitted/ is for tests that are to be submitted to W3C.
This directory is sync'ed automatically with the
contributors/mozilla/submitted/mozilla-central-reftests/
directory in the CSSWG repository. The master copy is Mozilla's.

received/ is for tests that are received from W3C.
This directory is sync'ed semi-automatically with the approved/
directory in the CSSWG repository. The master copy is CSSWG's.
Don't make changes here; they'll be overwritten by the next sync.

import-tests.py automatically imports a selection of CSSWG tests
from a clone of the https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests Git
repository.

Note that this will remove everything in the received/ directory when run,
so don't store anything in there.

failures.list is a list of reftests that fail in mozilla's
implementation of a given css module. Since the tests in are
checked-in to the mozilla tree after import, they are run in
the same manner as all other reftests in the tree. Thus, these
tests are marked as fails() when included in the reftest.list
file, so that new imports will not reawaken old oranges.
