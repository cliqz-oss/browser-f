# Ordered Floats

Provides several wrapper types for Ord and Eq implementations on f64.

This is a fork of https://crates.io/crates/ordered-float

## Usage

Use the crates.io repository; add this to your `Cargo.toml` along
with the rest of your dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
new-ordered-float = "1.0"
```

In your Rust code, the library name is still `ordered_float`:

```rust
extern crate ordered_float;
```

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/new-ordered-float) for further details.
