This is intended to run in jsshell-bench.  We are migrating this from arewefastyet:
https://github.com/mozilla/arewefastyet/tree/master/benchmarks/asmjs-apps

There is no documentation on where this was pulled from, but it appears to be related to:
https://github.com/kripken/Massive

This benchmark has .js files which are 'minified' and to save space, we have removed the raw files
which were stored in directories.  For example, box2d.js comes from the files in box2d/*.  We only
have box2d.js in here.
