`Fluent`_ is a new localization system, developed by Mozilla, which aims to replace
all existing localization models currently used at Mozilla.

In case of Firefox it directly superseeds DTD and StringBundle systems providing
a large number of new features and improvements over them both, for developers
and localizers.
