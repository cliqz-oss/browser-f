   * In devtools/client/sourceeditor/test/codemirror/search_test.js there is a test
   * multilineInsensitiveSlow which assumes an operation takes less than 100ms.
   * With a precision of 100ms, if we get unlikely and begin execution towards the
   * end of one spot (e.g. at 95 ms) we will clamp down, take (e.g.) 10ms to execute
   * and it will appear to take 100ms.
   *
   * To avoid this, we hardcode to 2ms of precision.
   *
   * In theory we don't need to set the pref for all of CodeMirror, in practice
   * it seems very difficult to set a pref for just one of the tests.
