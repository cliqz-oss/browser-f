   * Transmit streaming data via a bulk request.

   * The caller receives eventual access to a stream for writing.
   *
   * Since this opens up more options for how the server might respond (it could
   * send back either JSON or bulk data), and the returned Request object emits
   * events for different stages of the request process that you may want to
   * react to.
   *
   * @param request Object
   *        This is modeled after the format of JSON packets above, but does not
   *        actually contain the data, but is instead just a routing header:
   *          * actor:  Name of actor that will receive the packet
   *          * type:   Name of actor's method that should be called on receipt
   *          * length: Size of the data to be sent
   * @return Request
   *         This object emits a number of events to allow you to respond to
   *         different parts of the request lifecycle.
   *
   *         Events emitted:
   *         * bulk-send-ready: Ready to send bulk data to the server, using the
   *           event data object containing:
   *           * stream:   This output stream should only be used directly if

   *                       bytes and will not close the stream when writing is
   *                       complete
   *           * done:     If you use the stream directly (instead of |copyFrom|
