certificate_tag.go - script from Omaha project
  (https://github.com/google/omaha/blob/master/common/certificate_tag/certificate_tag.go)
  Used for prepare empty tagged area in binary file with digital signature. Later
  this area can be filled with any usefull information (look at ApplyTag.exe)

  Usage: go.exe run certificate_tag.go -set-superfluous-cert-tag=Gact2.0Omaha -padded-length=8206 -out out_name.exe input_file.exe


ApplyTag.exe - this is part of Omaha project (https://github.com/google/omaha),
  simple console application for injecting data into binary file, which must
  be signed and must have special area for data injection. We are decide to use
  data in inject area in next format: key1=value1&key2=value2&...

  Usage: ApplyTag.exe binary_for_inject.exe result_binary.exe "inject=data"

wix - the wrappers to build MSI installers for English and Deutsche version.
  Use different GUIDs, so this is two separate project for now. To build MSI
  with this files (*.wxs) you need to install wix (http://wixtoolset.org/),
  version 3.10 work perfectly now. To build you need to put installers near
  wxs file, change version in this file, if necessary and run two command:
    candle cliqz_msi_de.wix.wxs
    light cliqz_msi_de.wix.wixobj

  As result you will have MSI installer.
  This work based on this ticket: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231062
